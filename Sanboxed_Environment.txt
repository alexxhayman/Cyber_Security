Overview:

  The objective of this task is to deploy a sandboxed network. 
  There are 5 virtual machines in this sandboxed environment:
    1. Ubuntu Server and Gateway
    2. Kali Linux
    3. Ubuntu 14.04 (wordpress)
    4. Ubuntu 22.04 (wordpress)
    5. Windows 10

  All devices on the network will have their network cards pointed internally, except for the ubuntu server and gateway. 
  The gateway will have it's first network card set to NAT (external network) and the second network card will be pointed inwards.

Setting up the virtual machines:

# Command Terminal

- use “ip a” to view the IP Address of the device you are on for linux terminals
- ctrl c will cancel the current operation (will stop the endless scrolling of text)
- ping IP address is used to view connection between 2 devices
- clicking the up arrow key will show you what values have been entered into the terminal

### Importing Virtual Machines

- when you import a virtual machine onto your machine using a virtual box - it gives the machine a new mac address - we need to change this in order to communicate with the device
- you can control a virtual machine using the graphical interface or using the terminal
- we need to use the terminal in this case

### when you close a virtual machine:

- click file and close and power off


## hecking internet connection

nslookup "domain_name"

the shell, terminal and command line are all the same thing

## Backing up virtual machines

- File
- export appliance
- change version to 2.0

Setting up the windows machine

virtual box windows

- new
- find your iso file
- name it windows 10
- uncheck skip unattended installation
- change to 4gb ram
- 1 cpu
- leave storage at 50gb
    - leave preallocate full size unchecked so that it does not partition the whole drive straigth away
    - it will rather use up the space as it needs leaving space if you dont use it
- make your subnet mask length 24
- change ip address to 192.168.123.40
- change dns to 8.8.4.4

make sure you switch the firewall off to see if you can ping other devices on the network

unattended mode
